<b>J# version:</b>

<p>
to use the .NET J# version of TurtleTracks Logo, you need to first install:
<ul>
<li> .NET framework (get it from <a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Windows Update</a>, from the "Windows updates" category (instead of the default "Critical Updates" category)
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vjsharp/downloads/howtoget/default.aspx" target="_blank">Visual J# .NET Redistributable Package</a>
</ul>
</p>

<UL>

<LI>for .NET 1.0 and J# 1.0:

 <P>
  Sources of <A HREF="1.0/turtle_tracks_source_jsharp_20030510a.zip">TurtleTracks Logo for J#</A> (J# is a Microsoft .NET compiler that turns Java 1.1 source code into .NET Intermediate Language [IL])<br>
  Porting to J# by G.Birbilis (needed some small changes to the original Java version sources, search for "Birb" in the sources to find those changes)
 </P>

 <p>
  A <A HREF="1.0/TurtleTracks.net_CommandLine_20030510a.zip">command-line console</a> application of TurtleTracks Logo (need to have the .NET Runtime installed, can get it from <a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com" target="_blank">http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com</a>)
 </p>

 <p>
  A <A HREF="1.0/TurtleTracks.net_GUI_20030510a.zip">GUI console</a> application of TurtleTracks Logo (need to have the .NET Runtime installed, can get it from <a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com" target="_blank">http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com</a>)<br>
  Can give the "DRAW" command to open a Turtle Graphics window (then control the turle via FORWARD / BACK / LEFT / RIGHT / PENUP / PENDOWN / etc. commands - see <a href="http://turtletracks.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">TurtleTracks documentation</a> for more)
 </p>

<P>
the two .EXE files (command-line and GUI consoles) were compiled with J#1.0 and .NET1.0 and so they need the respective versions of .NET and J# installed (those can coexist with newer .NET and J# versions). Else you can recompile/rebuild the source code yourself using the latest J# version and .NET runtime
</P>

<LI>for .NET 1.1 and J# 1.1:

<P>
<a href="1.1/TurtleTracks.net_20041028.zip">TurtleTracks.net_20041028.zip</a> contains the TurtleTracks.net as several .NET assembly (=library) and application projects (compiled with J#/.NET 1.1)<BR><BR>
It also contains a partial on-going port to C# (using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080406104844/http://msdn.microsoft.com:80/vstudio/java/migrate/jlca/default.aspx" target="_blank">JLCA</a> - Java Language Conversion Assistant - from MS)
